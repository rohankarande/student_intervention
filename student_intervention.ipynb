In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "1. Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "Real world application:\n",
    "a. SVM can be used for Gender Classification Based on 3D Face Geometry \n",
    "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5279671/\n",

    "b. Recognizing hand-written digits\n",
    "http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_digits_classification.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths:\n",
    "SVM supports kernels & soft-margin SVM, so we can model even non-linear relations.\n",
    "Training is relatively easy. No local optimal, unlike in neural networks.\n",
    "It scales relatively well to high dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness:\n",
    "One limitation of the support vector approach lies in choice of the kernel. Incorrect choice of kernel can lead to overfitting or high-bias.\n",
    "A second limitation is speed and size, both in training and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM is a classification SLM which seperates data into different groups by a dividing the hyperplane. In this project our goal is to classify students dataset into two, students who need intervention and students who dont. Thus SVM can be used to find a hyperplane to seperate students into above two groups as required.\n",
    "Also natural task for SVM is binary classification, which is exactly the case in this project.Also it scales relatively well to high dimensional data (given there are 30 features). Also as data is not large, speed and size will not be an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Decision Tree:\n",
    "Real world application:\n",
    "a. Object recognition: Tree based classification has been used recently for recognizing three dimensional objects [338,39] and for high level vision [184].\n",

    "b. Molecular biology: Decision trees for analyzing amino acid sequences.\n",
    "http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~salzberg/docs/murthy_thesis/survey/node32.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths:\n",
    "1. Decision trees implicitly perform variable screening or feature selection.\n",
    "When we fit a decision tree to a training dataset, the top few nodes on which the tree is split are essentially the most important variables within the dataset and with decision tree feature selection is completed automatically.\n",
    "2. Decision trees require relatively little effort from users for data preparation.\n",
    "o overcome scale differences between parameters - for example if we have a dataset which measures revenue in millions and loan age in years, say; this will require some form of normalization or scaling before we can fit a regression model and interpret the coefficients.  Such variable transformations are not required with  decision trees because the tree structure will remain the same with or without the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another feature which saves data prep time: missing values will not prevent splitting the data for building trees. \n",
    "Decision trees are also not sensitive to outliers since the splitting happens based on proportion of samples within the split ranges and not on absolute values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Nonlinear relationships between parameters do not affect tree performance.\n",
    "Decision trees do not require any assumptions of linearity in the data. Thus, we can use them in scenarios where we know the parameters are nonlinearly related.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The best feature of using trees for analytics - easy to interpret and explain to executives!\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness:\n",
    "1. Without proper pruning or limiting tree growth, they tend to overfit the training data, making them somewhat poor predictors.\n",
    "2. \tTree splitting is locally greedy – At each level, tree looks for binary split such that impurity of tree is reduced by maximum amount. This is a greedy algorithm and may result in local optima.\n",

    "Strengths:\n",
    "1. Does not learn a single classifier but learns a set of classifiers & combines the predictions of multiple classifiers, parameters to get higher accuracy.\n",
    "2. Reduces overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness:\n",
    "1. Increased storage. Instead of a single classifier all component classifiers,need to be stored after training. The total storage depends on the size of each component classifier itself and the size of the ensemble (number of classifiers in the ensemble).Performance will be limited when computational storage is limited.\n",
    "2. Increased computation. Takes longer time,(* at times days) to provide results since  to classify an input query, all component classifiers (instead of a single classifier) must be processed, and thus it requires more execution time.  Not suitable when smaller computation time is a factor.\n"
